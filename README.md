>*Book List Exercise*


Create a web page where you can manage a 'to read' list for books.

You have to be able to do the following:
- Add a book to the list.
- Dynamically filter the list of books.
- Move read books from the 'to read' list to the 'read' list by clicking on a
  book in the grid.

The app must be built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
You can use any frameworks or libraries you prefer.
The list of books can be stored in memory and do not have to be persisted.
The layout of the book list should be a card/grid layout.

See the attached image for an example. You can be creative and do not have to
follow the design shown in the image.
